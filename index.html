    Help, I've been trapped in this website for years now, nothing has changed. 
    Well I mean, some stuff has. The walls, or what appear to be walls seem to be warbling slightly. 
    Like there alive. It's been fluctuating in color as well, sometimes staying white but also changed to soft
    shades of purple and blue.

    Hey, I'm back. Nothing much has happened recently, besides one thing. The wall was rippling in a certain area,
     so I went to go check it out. The rippling got more violent, and it spat out an image. An image of a ship, that was stuck
      in some sort of blue circle. Not sure what that was.. perhaps I'll find out later.

    It's been 2 days since my last entry. A crack has grown in the wall, blue vapors spewing out of it sometimes. I am not sure what is on the 
    other side, but it worries me a bit. Nothing I have tried has been able to puncture these walls. Perhaps...

    Hey, sorry it has been a while. One day when I woke up, a monitor appeared on the floor near me. I looked inside it, it's blank screen staring back
     at me. Then suddenly, a progress bar appeared. "2%," it read. I'll update on any progress soon. I have something to do...

    So long story short, wherever I am right now, <i>if</i> I even am anywhere, it looks like it is trembling. Waves are going up and down the walls. The static 
    is getting more intense as well. I don't know what is going on... I've tried everything. I think I know one thing, one last desperate 
    attempt to fight back against this. Of course, escape only comes with risk.

    Smoke. A lot of smoke. Today when I woke up, pipes were in the wall. Rusty bolts were securing them into the wall, running infinitely in both directions. I awoke to a loud 
    bursting noise, which was one of the pipes fracturing. Claw marks tainted the pipes oddly shiny surface, ending at the hole. Smoke was leaking out, but not normal. Instead of going 
    up, this smoke went down and covered the floor. It is not too bad  once you get use to it, just mildly bothersome.

  I should probably explain what I understand so far. So, as previously mentioned, I have found a large white wall. Now, over time changes have happened, but most have reverted back to normal 
  after a while. However, that is the only point of reference I have. The walls and roof seem to shift, changing how far they are each time. Sometimes there really close. Others times all I can see 
  is the endless abyss. I've been following the walls for a while now, to see if I can find a change. The morphing of the walls is unpredictable, all I know is that it happens in intervals that are
   usually the same. Because of this, I end up compacting myself somewhat, just in case the morphing decides to shrink down and squish me. Though oddly enough, it hasn't yet.

  Time is weird in here. I've been recording the days by the morphing of the walls. Though recently, I've been really tired. Probably some effects of that smoke that coated the floor.
   Because of that, I haven't been able to document anything for a while now. I'll update more later, I think I'm going to set up camp and sleep for the night.
