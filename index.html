    Help, I've been trapped in this website for years now, nothing has changed. 
    Well I mean, some stuff has. The walls, or what appear to be walls seem to be warbling slightly. 
    Like there alive. It's been fluctuating in color as well, sometimes staying white but also changed to soft
    shades of purple and blue.

    Hey, I'm back. Nothing much has happened recently, besides one thing. The wall was rippling in a certain area,
     so I went to go check it out. The rippling got more violent, and it spat out an image. An image of a ship, that was stuck
      in some sort of blue circle. Not sure what that was.. perhaps I'll find out later.
