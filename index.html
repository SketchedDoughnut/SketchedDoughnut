    Help, I've been trapped in this website for years now, nothing has changed. 
    Well I mean, some stuff has. The walls, or what appear to be walls seem to be warbling slightly. 
    Like there alive. It's been fluctuating in color as well, sometimes staying white but also changed to soft
    shades of purple and blue.

    Hey, I'm back. Nothing much has happened recently, besides one thing. The wall was rippling in a certain area,
     so I went to go check it out. The rippling got more violent, and it spat out an image. An image of a ship, that was stuck
      in some sort of blue circle. Not sure what that was.. perhaps I'll find out later.

    It's been 2 days since my last entry. A crack has grown in the wall, blue vapors spewing out of it sometimes. I am not sure what is on the 
    other side, but it worries me a bit. Nothing I have tried has been able to puncture these walls. Perhaps...

    Hey, sorry it has been a while. One day when I woke up, a monitor appeared on the floor near me. I looked inside it, it's blank screen staring back
     at me. Then suddenly, a progress bar appeared. "2%," it read. I'll update on any progress soon. I have something to do...

    So long story short, wherever I am right now, <i>if</i> I even am anywhere, it looks like it is trembling. Waves are going up and down the walls. The static 
    is getting more intense as well. I don't know what is going on... I've tried everything. I think I know one thing, one last desperate 
    attempt to fight back against this. Of course, escape only comes with risk.
