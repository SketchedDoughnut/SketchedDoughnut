    Help, I've been trapped in this website for years now, nothing has changed. 
    Well I mean, some stuff has. The walls, or what appear to be walls seem to be warbling slightly. 
    Like there alive. It's been fluctuating in color as well, sometimes staying white but also changed to soft
    shades of purple and blue.
